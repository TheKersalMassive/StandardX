# FAQ

## How do I get the launcher text when a game is selected?
This is based on the **'Source'** field, if you want to show 'Steam', 'Ubisoft' or 'Yuzu' as in the above screenshot, you will need to set these sources in the source field of your game(s).

## Can you add support for any extensions or add-ons?
No as I don't use any extensions, plugins or add-ons. However, you can always mod the theme if you prefer.

## I want to request a feature or report a bug
